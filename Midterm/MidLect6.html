                &ensp;&ensp; The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry is a timeless story about innocence, love, and human nature. The narrator, an aviator, crashes in the Sahara Desert, where he meets a mysterious boy—the Little Prince—who asks him to draw a sheep. 
                As they spend time together, the Prince shares stories of his travels across different planets, meeting strange adults who each represent human flaws, such as vanity, greed, and blind obedience. 
                He comes from a small asteroid, B-612, where he cares for a unique rose but leaves after feeling unappreciated. On Earth, he befriends a wise fox who teaches him that "what is essential is invisible to the eye." 
                This lesson helps him realize that his rose is special because of the love and time he has given her. Longing to return home, the Prince allows a snake to bite him, believing it will free his soul. The narrator never sees him again but believes he still exists among the stars. 
                The story highlights the importance of looking at the world with a child’s heart, valuing love over material things. It also critiques the way adults often focus on meaningless pursuits instead of what truly matters. Through its poetic and philosophical storytelling, 
                The Little Prince remains a beloved classic that encourages readers to cherish relationships, curiosity, and imagination.</p>
